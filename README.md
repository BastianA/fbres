## Running the application on a local web server
Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
cd your/desired/path/
git clone https://github.com/BastianA/fbres.git
```
To run the application locally we need to serve it through a simulated web server.
Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Now cd into the project directory and type `npm run serve` to run the server.  
The server will be served at `http://localhost:8080/` per default.
